# 🐍 Snake Game - Python Project

This is a classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` module.  
I created this project as part of my Python bootcamp (up to Day 35) to practice loops, event handling, and logic building.

## 🎮 Features:
- Snake grows when it eats food
- Score tracking and Game Over on collision
- Built using Turtle graphics (no external libraries)
- Keyboard controls for movement

## 📘 What I Learned:
- Game loops and real-time updates
- Event handling using `onkey()` and `listen()`
- Collision detection logic
- Organizing code with functions and classes

## ▶️ How to Run:
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone this repo or download the code
3. Run `main.py` (or the file with game logic) in PyCharm or any IDE

## 📸 Screenshot:
Please take a look at the screenshot of the project by opening the file `snake_project.png` included in this repository.
